# Formula 1 Exploration

For my capstone, I will be exploring a Formula 1 Racing dataset from 1950-present. 

## Background

Formula racing is a widely popular form of motosport road racing. It requires the chassis and engines of the cars to adhere to a set of specifications, but in open formula racing, a team is allowed to choose or design the chassis and/or engine to fit said specifications.

## Questions

What makes for a successful driver? What makes for a successful constructor? Can you just buy your way the the constructors cup? 

Lewis Hamilton, who had one World Drivers' Championship (WDC) in 2008 before switching teams in 2013, to a Mercedes Constructor team that had only won only 2 WDC trophies in the 60 years prior. He has since won 5 straight WDC trophies, how did he achieve that? What changed?

## Goals

I want to determine what resources and factors increase or decrease the likelihood of winning a F1 race. Some of the factors I wanted to examine are pole positions, fastest laps, engine manufacturers, chassis manufacturers, and tire compositions, home country track advantage, among many others.
